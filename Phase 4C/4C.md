# Project 1 - Phase 4.A
- Requirements:
    - Create Scenarios Requiring Multiple Resource Locks
    - Demonstrate How Deadlocks can Occur
    - Implement Deadlock Detection
    
- Created a second public mutex lock in the driver class
- Intentionally mismatched the order of the two mutex lock acquisitions between the two methods. (One method will obtain in order mutex1, mutex2, second will obtain in order mutex2, mutex1)
- Removed any timeout features, enabling occurrence of deadlocks.
- Created some scenarios for timing out (unused in this phase)

- In the driver, implemented DateTime usages to monitor IRL time passage and measure them against a soft-coded timeout.
- For a brief (5s) moment, the main method will continuously check if any of the initial 20 threads are still running. (This time is arbitrarily scaled down for testing, the deadlock will never release regardless of timeout.)
- System will print if a deadlock is detected.
