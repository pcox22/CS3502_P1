# Project 1 - Phase 4.A
- Requirements:
    - Create threads that perform concurrent operations
        - Accomplished by creating two Lists of 10 threads, run simultaneously
    - Demonstrate proper thread creation and management
    - Show basic thread safety principles
    
- Created two Lists of 10 threads each in Driver class, and one list of 10 ATrain objects (initially Train, broken into A, B, ...Train)
- Set each thread in both lists to either of two methods in the Train class: Depart, or Maintenance
    - Both methods contain custom messages and sleep times to simulate different operations or processes
    - Fulfills Concurrency
    
- Trains are created with a random station number (irrelevant to requirements, meant to demonstrate alternative processes)
