# Project 1 - Phase 4.B
- Requirements:
    - Implement Mutex Locks for Shared Resource Protection
    - Demonstrate Proper Lock Acquisition and Release
    - Show Synchronized Access to Shared Resources
    
- Created a public mutex lock in the driver class
- Inside the methods specified in the previous phase, inserted acquisition methods for the lock, and releases once all work was done in the process (after the critical section)
- Created a static integer to maintain the number of operations completed: this integer is meant to act as the "shared resource," as both sets of threads are affecting it

- Note: There is now a notable delay in the completion of each process
- Usually 5 Tasks eventually "Fail" as a result of timing out while waiting for lock acquisition. This is intentional and meant to demonstrate handling those situations. To alter this, either extend or remove the wait time from the lock acquisitions.
