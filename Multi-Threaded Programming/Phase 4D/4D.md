# Project 1 - Phase 4.D
- Requirements:
    - Implement Timeout Mechanisms
    - Add Proper Resource Ordering
    - Show Deadlock Prevention and Recovery
    
- Reinstated mutex acquisition timeouts to prevent deadlocks
- Reordered mutex acquisitions to prevent two different processes from holding a resource the other required
- Extended the Deadlock detection timeout to 30s to give reasonable time for processes to complete

- At this point in time, the project contains Multi-Threaded Programming, Synchronization Aspects, Deadlock Prevention, Shared Resources, and Resource Ordering.
- Note: Moved the totalOperations variable inside the train class to the second mutex acquisition for each method. Ideally, the process was only fully successful if it was able to obtain both locks.
